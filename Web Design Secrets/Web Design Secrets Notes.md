#### I. Typography

1) Keep your font between 15 and 25 px.

2) Use really big font sizes for headlines. For example, 32px or 60px! There are no limits. Generally you'll want lower font weights for larger fonts.

3) Use line spacing between 120 and 150%.

4) 45 to 90 characters per line.

5) Use good fonts. There are no real rules for this. Google web fonts is a good place to get web fonts.

  How do you choose a font face?
  
  1) Choose a font which reflects the look and feel you want for your website.
  
  2) Decide if you want a sans-serif or serif typeface? Sans-serif are more modern while serif typefaces are more traditional. The latter
  is good if you have a lot of text.
  
  3) Use a good font.
  
  4) Use only that one typeface or pair two good fonts. Play around with them.
  
#### II. Colors

1) Use only one base color.

2) Use a tool if you want to use more colors.

3) Use color to draw attention.

4) Never use black in your design.

5) Choose colors wisely. Certain colors evoke psychological responses from the user.
