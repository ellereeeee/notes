## I. Typography

1) Keep your font between 15 and 25 px.

2) Use really big font sizes for headlines. For example, 32px or 60px! There are no limits. Generally you'll want lower font weights for larger fonts.

3) Use line spacing between 120 and 150%.

4) 45 to 90 characters per line.

5) Use good fonts. There are no real rules for this. Google web fonts is a good place to get web fonts.

  How do you choose a font face?
  
  1) Choose a font which reflects the look and feel you want for your website.
  
  2) Decide if you want a sans-serif or serif typeface? Sans-serif are more modern while serif typefaces are more traditional. The latter
  is good if you have a lot of text.
  
  3) Use a good font.
  
  4) Use only that one typeface or pair two good fonts. Play around with them.
  
## II. Colors

1) Use only one base color.

2) Use a tool if you want to use more colors.

3) Use color to draw attention.

4) Never use black in your design.

5) Choose colors wisely. Certain colors evoke psychological responses from the user.

## III. Working with Images

1) Put text directly on an image. Make sure there is color contrast between the text color and image.

2) You can overlay the image with a color to create contract betweent text and image color.

3) Put your text in a box to make it easy to read.

4) Blur the image. Make sure the text stays over the blurred image for all resolutions.

5) Use the "floor fade" technique. This is when you darken the bottom of an image and use lighter text over it. Here is example CSS:

```
.floor-fade {

background: linear-gradient(to bottom, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0), rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6) ), url(YOUR IMAGE HERE);

}
```

6) Use your picture or use free ones online, like at Unsplash.com.

## IV. Working with Icons

1) Use icons to list features/steps.

2) Use icons for actions and links. Your icons should be recognizable and your links should be labeled.

3) Icons should not take center stage. They should play a supporting role in your design.

4) Use icon fonts whenever possible. Icon fonts use vector images that scale at any resolution.

5) There are lots of free icons online.
